# mto-tools

A bunch of dumb scripts I use for working on [MTO](https://mtosmt.org). They
lived in my Dropbox forever, but now that I have been a Professional
Programmer for a few years now I decided to put them here and make them less
terrible.

Do whatever you want with them, though I can't imagine they'll possibly be
useful. I'll stick 'em under MIT.
